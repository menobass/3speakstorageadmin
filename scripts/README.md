   ```bash
   ./scripts/status-check.sh
   ```

2. **Start with the safest cleanup:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/free-deleted-videos.sh
   ```

## 📋 Available Scripts

### 🔍 `status-check.sh` - Storage Overview

   - **Risk Level:** Medium - Reviews criteria before proceeding

### 🪣 `s3-diet.sh` - S3 Storage Optimizer (S3 Videos Only) 🆕
**What it does:** Optimizes S3 storage by keeping only 480p, removes higher resolutions
**Storage Type:** ✅ **S3 videos only** - selective file deletion possible
**Safety:** Low risk (videos remain watchable in 480p)
**Reality Check:** Platform stopped using S3 4 years ago - limited savings expected (~1,000 S3 videos)
**Storage Impact:** 60-80% reduction per S3 video (selective resolution deletion)
**When to use:** If you have newer S3 uploads to optimize

```bash
./scripts/s3-diet.sh
```

### 🗂️ `ipfs-diet.sh` - IPFS Storage Optimizer (IPFS Videos Only - THE BIG ONE) 🆕
**What it does:** Unpins low-engagement IPFS videos to completely free storage space
**Storage Type:** ✅ **IPFS videos only** - all-or-nothing unpinning (no partial deletion possible)
**Safety:** ⚠️ HIGH IMPACT - Videos become completely inaccessible after unpinning
**Reality Check:** This is where the major storage savings happen (~130K IPFS videos)
**Storage Impact:** 100% freed per unpinned video (complete removal from IPFS node)
**Technical Note:** IPFS doesn't support partial deletion - you can only pin (accessible) or unpin (inaccessible)
**When to use:** When you need significant storage savings and can sacrifice old, low-engagement content

```bash
./scripts/ipfs-diet.sh
```

### 🥗 `slim-user.sh` - Targeted User Storage Diet (S3 Videos Only) 🆕
**What it does:** User-focused storage optimization for specific accounts
**Storage Type:** ✅ **S3 videos only** - IPFS videos cannot be "slimmed" (all-or-nothing)
**Safety:** Medium (targets only old S3 videos from specific user)
**Features:** Cost savings calculation, age-based targeting, keeps videos watchable in 480p
**Space saved:** ~70% reduction per optimized S3 video
**Limitation:** Cannot optimize IPFS videos (use ipfs-diet.sh to unpin IPFS videos instead)
**When to use:** Optimize specific users with S3 content, reduce storage costs for inactive creators

```bash
./scripts/slim-user.sh
```

### ✂️ `trim-fat.sh` - Account Fat Trimming (Both Storage Types - FLEXIBLE) 🆕
**What it does:** Removes old or low-engagement content from specific accounts with flexible criteria
**Storage Type:** ✅ **Both S3 and IPFS** - intelligently handles different storage types appropriately
**Operations:** S3 files deleted, IPFS hashes unpinned (content becomes inaccessible)
**Safety:** Medium-High (account-specific with age/engagement filters)
**Features:** Flexible age thresholds, engagement filtering, combined criteria, dry-run preview
**Space saved:** Varies - targets underperforming content (typically significant savings)
**Flexibility:** Age-based (1-10 years), engagement-based (50-5000 views), or combined criteria
**When to use:** Clean up specific accounts with old/unwanted content, reduce storage costs with precision

```bash
./scripts/trim-fat.sh
```

### ☢️ `nuke-account.sh` - Nuclear Account Deletion (Both Storage Types - EXTREME)
**What it does:** Erases every trace of a specific account from all storage systems
**Storage Type:** ✅ **Both S3 and IPFS** - intelligently detects and applies appropriate destruction method
**Operations:** S3 files deleted, IPFS hashes unpinned, database records removed
**Safety:** ⚠️ EXTREME - completely irreversible, use only with absolute certainty
**When to use:** Legal takedowns, DMCA requests, or malicious accounts that must be fully purged

```bash
./scripts/nuke-account.sh
```

## �️ Storage Type Understanding

**📊 Current Video Distribution:**
- **S3 Videos:** ~1,000 videos (newer uploads, before platform switched to IPFS)
- **IPFS Videos:** ~130,000 videos (majority of platform content)  
- **Unknown/Failed:** ~200,000+ processing tokens/failed uploads

**🔧 Storage Type Operations:**

### S3 Videos (Selective Operations Possible):
- **✅ Can be "slimmed":** Delete high-resolution files, keep 480p → videos remain watchable
- **✅ Can be deleted:** Remove all files → videos become inaccessible
- **Tools:** `s3-diet.sh` (slim), `slim-user.sh` (slim S3 only), cleanup commands (delete)

### IPFS Videos (All-or-Nothing Operations):
- **❌ Cannot be "slimmed":** IPFS is atomic - you cannot delete "part" of a video
- **✅ Can be unpinned:** Remove from IPFS node → videos become completely inaccessible  
- **Technical:** IPFS videos exist as complete content-addressed hashes, no partial states
- **Tools:** `ipfs-diet.sh` (unpin), cleanup commands (unpin)

### Universal Operations (Both Types):
- **✅ Complete removal:** `nuke-account.sh`, `cleanup.ts` commands
- **Logic:** Detects storage type automatically and applies appropriate method:
  - S3: Deletes all files and HLS segments
  - IPFS: Unpins content hash from node

**💡 Key Insight:** Major storage savings come from IPFS unpinning (~130K videos), not S3 optimization (~1K videos)

## �🛡️ Safety Features

✅ **Every script includes:**
- Automatic project building
- Safety checks before execution
- Dry run preview of changes
- Interactive confirmations  
- Progress monitoring
- Error handling
- Full logging

✅ **Smart defaults:**

## 🎛️ Script Options Explained

### Batch Sizes:
- **Small (10-25):** Safest, takes longer, easier to stop if needed
- **Medium (25-100):** Balanced, good for regular use
- **Large (100-250):** Faster, use when confident

### Age Thresholds (for stuck uploads):
- **30 days:** Very conservative, only clearly failed uploads
- **90 days:** Moderate, good for first cleanup
- **180+ days:** Aggressive, use when storage is critical

## 🚨 Emergency Stop

**If something goes wrong:**
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop any running script
- All scripts can be safely re-run (they skip already processed videos)
- Check `./logs/app.log` for detailed information

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**"ERROR: Please run this script from the 3speakstorageadmin directory"**
- Solution: `cd /path/to/3speakstorageadmin` first

**"Build failed"**
- Solution: Run `npm install` then try again

**"No videos found"**
- This is good! It means that category is already clean

## 📈 Expected Results

**After running `free-deleted-videos.sh`:**
- 4-6 TB of storage freed up
- 16,000+ admin-deleted video records cleaned
- S3 storage costs reduced

**After running `remove-banned-content.sh`:**
- All content from 438 banned users removed
- Policy compliance improved

**After running `clean-stuck-uploads.sh`:**
- Failed uploads removed
- Database cleaned up
- Storage efficiency improved

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always start with status-check.sh** to understand current state
2. **Use free-deleted-videos.sh first** - it's the safest big win
3. **For major storage savings, use ipfs-diet.sh** - this is where the big wins are (old IPFS content)
4. **s3-diet.sh has limited impact** - platform stopped using S3 4 years ago
5. **Start with small batch sizes** until you're comfortable
6. **Run during off-peak hours** for less system impact
7. **Check logs** if anything seems unusual: `tail -f logs/app.log`

## 🎯 For VPS Deployment
