## 🎛️ Script Options Explained

### Batch Sizes:
- **Small (10-25):** Safest, takes longer, easier to stop if needed
- **Medium (25-100):** Balanced, good for regular use
- **Large (100-250):** Faster, use when confident

### Age Thresholds (for stuck uploads):
- **30 days:** Very conservative, only clearly failed uploads
- **90 days:** Moderate, good for first cleanup
- **180+ days:** Aggressive, use when storage is critical

## 🚨 Emergency Stop

**If something goes wrong:**
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop any running script
- All scripts can be safely re-run (they skip already processed videos)
- Check `./logs/app.log` for detailed information

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**"ERROR: Please run this script from the 3speakstorageadmin directory"**
- Solution: `cd /path/to/3speakstorageadmin` first

**"Build failed"**
- Solution: Run `npm install` then try again

**"No videos found"**
- This is good! It means that category is already clean

## 📈 Expected Results

**After running `free-deleted-videos.sh`:**
- 4-6 TB of storage freed up
- 16,000+ admin-deleted video records cleaned
- S3 storage costs reduced

**After running `remove-banned-content.sh`:**
- All content from 438 banned users removed
- Policy compliance improved

**After running `clean-stuck-uploads.sh`:**
- Failed uploads removed
- Database cleaned up
- Storage efficiency improved

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always start with status-check.sh** to understand current state
2. **Use free-deleted-videos.sh first** - it's the safest big win
3. **For major storage savings, use ipfs-diet.sh** - this is where the big wins are (old IPFS content)
4. **s3-diet.sh has limited impact** - platform stopped using S3 4 years ago
5. **Start with small batch sizes** until you're comfortable
6. **Run during off-peak hours** for less system impact
7. **Check logs** if anything seems unusual: `tail -f logs/app.log`

## 🎯 For VPS Deployment

Once comfortable with the scripts, you can automate them:

```bash
# Add to crontab for automated cleanup

0 */6 * * * cd /path/to/3speakstorageadmin && ./scripts/free-deleted-videos.sh

# Weekly stuck upload cleanup
